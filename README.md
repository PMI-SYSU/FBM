# Fermi-Bose Machine
The code for "Fermi-Bose Machine" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13631). In this paper we design a semantically meaningful representation learning, we discard backpropagation, and instead, propose a local contrastive learning, where the representation for the inputs bearing the same label shrink (akin to boson) in hidden layers, while those of different labels repel (akin to fermion).

# Requirements
* python 3.9.12 (lower version may also ok)
* torch 1.3.1 (pytorch)

# How to run
The code is organised into several ipynb files, corresponding to the figures in the main text.
